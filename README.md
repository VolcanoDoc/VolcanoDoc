- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VolcanoDoc
- ðŸ‘€ I study igneous petrology, magma dynamics, and volcanology to better understand what happens before a volcano erupts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (transitioning over from MATLAB) & writing code to process data from my PhD dissertation & for future research projects.
